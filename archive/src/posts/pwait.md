I've been frustrated with the lack of [pwait][pw] on Linux for a while now.
[wait][w] exists, but it's limited by the fact that it can only monitor child
processes of the current shell.

The simplest version of a pwait is:

    $ while [ -e /proc/${pid} ]; do sleep 0.1; done

While simple and straightforward, it lacks a few things I've added into a more
robust Bash version:

    - monitoring multiple pids
    - monitoring processes based on name

I looked into an event driven implementation (using `tail --pid`) but was
rejected due to lack of `--pid` support in BusyBox's implementation.

Anyway, you can find `pwait` at this [GitHub repo][gh].
