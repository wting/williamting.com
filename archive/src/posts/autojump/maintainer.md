Title: Autojump Maintainer
Tags: autojump, open source

Just took over as maintainer for the autojump project. :)

If you spend any significant amount of time in the terminal, I suggest you check
it out. It's a small utility that learns which directories are used the most
often and lets you change directory based on a shorthand command.

Autojump is already available in most distros' repositories (Debian-based,
RedHat-based, Arch, Gentoo) and for Mac (Homebrew or MacPorts).

For the latest version and more info, visit the project
[page](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump).
