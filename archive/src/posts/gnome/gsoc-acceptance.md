Title: GSOC 2012 - Epiphany Sync
Tags: google, summer, code, 2012, gnome, epiphany, sync

My proposal to implement synchronization in Gnome's Epiphany browser was recently accepted into [Google Summer of Code 2012][gsoc]. I'm pretty excited about the prospects of working with the Gnome team over the next few months.

I've gone ahead and updated my [project page][gh] with a condensed version of my submitted proposal for those interested. I'm open to any suggestions on how to improve the design, so don't hesitate to comment below.
