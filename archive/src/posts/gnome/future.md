## A Bright Future for Gnome – Juan José Sánchez, Xan Lopez

Last week Ben Otte wrote a scathing [post][botte] about the future of GNOME, with Christian Schaller [responding][cschaller].

Juan and Xan talked about GNOME's current status, some of the most pressing problems and how to solve them.

Given the fracturing of GNOME since the 2 &rarr; 3 transition, their summary was to target mobile and tablet devices, and migrate GNOME as an OS or final product.

> The plan would be a way to keep resources inside the project and hopefully recover/attract more, and we would need the support of the board, release team, and the main maintainers, developers and specially of the companies currently investing in GNOME to make it feasible.

> I don’t think targeting laptops and workstations is all that useful. Icaza talked about this in his “GNOME” proposal, and I was completely unconvinced.
