Title: Going to GUADEC!
Tags: gnome, guadec

I was recently sponsored by the GNOME Travel Committee to go to [GUADEC][conf]! I'm pretty excited about attending the conference, participating in hackathons, and visiting Europe for the first time.

I've also submitted a proposal to give a Lightning Talk, so hopefully I'll get to present my project at the conference as well.
