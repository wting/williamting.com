Title: Why We Bookmark
Tags: bookmark, reference, chrome, extension, saving
Status: draft

Brian Groudan over at Mozilla conducted a [study][moz] into how and why users
bookmark URLs.  I think it can be further simplified even further into
three categories: Now, Later, and Future.

## Now

This is the stuff you use daily: email, calendar, news, Facebook, etc. In the
past companies like Yahoo! focused on portal sites that fulfilled all these
needs. Now everyone has moved over to a tab driven workflow of specialized
sites.

I'm keyboard driven, so I've solved this problem with [Quickmarks][qm]. Simply,
I type a command `b email` in my address bar to visit my email. In reality, I've
simplified all my common sites to single letter aliases such as `b c ` to visit
Google Calendar rather than depend on address bar auto-completion.

## Later

Stuff here can be broken down into two subcategories for me: stuff to read and
stuff to work on.

Stuff to read later is solved by [Pocket][pocket] (formerly Read It Later). It's
essentially a reading to do list. It's even better when you use the phone /
tablet app since there is push synchronization support allowing for offline
reading. I find it useful for commutes, traveling, or reading in bed.

Stuff to work on is solved by [Stash][st]. I've adopted a one window per topic /
task workflow. Using Stash allows me to conveniently save / load windows full of
tabs to temporarily suspend work and continue later.

## Future

Future can also be broken down into two subcategories: content to save and
links to save "just in case".

[Evernote][en] handles the content I want to save pretty well with tagging
support to recall it efficiently.

Bookmarks only handle the last case where I don't mind losing the content.
Honestly, most of the time I can depend on address bar completion or a quick
Google search to find content I need.

On a side note, despite this popular request for [tagging support][bug] in Chrome's
bookmarks from 3 years ago it still hasn't been implemented, so I'm stuck using
a complicated folder hierarchy instead.
